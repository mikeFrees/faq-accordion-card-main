## Overview

### The project

My challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript

The design:
